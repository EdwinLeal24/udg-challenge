## Used technologies / Frameworks

I use the following technologies / frameworks in my project:

- JavaScript / React / Nextjs

I have developed this project with Javascript because is the languaje I feel more confortable.

The project is made with [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) wich is a framework of React.

I have choosed this framework because I feel confortable working with React and because you don't need any extra configuration to start to work. Nextjs offers a serie of interesting adventages, like server side rendering, provides an integrated eslint, optimization for images and fonts, just with one command you can have the app ready to deploy and many more.

## Used 3rd Party Libraries

I use the following 3rd party libraries in my project:

Name | Reason
--- | ---
[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) | To have component-level styles, I think the components looks cleaner using the styled components, it is easy to have dynamic styles with props and you don't have to worry about class name bugs.
[react-colorful](https://omgovich.github.io/react-colorful/) | It's a tiny color picker component for React, I have used it to generate the color picker for the font.
[Next UI](https://nextui.org/) | It's a UI Library of nextjs, it's still in beta version but provides a very nice ccomponents to build interesting and beautiful interfaces, I have used some components from this library to see how it works because I have never used it before.

## Installation / Run

The following components must be installed locally:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 12.22.0 or later

To run the project locally, enter the following in the command line / bash:

```console
